Identification of the type of reaction is not a proxy for seriousness or risk of harm to the patient, which is better expressed by the manifestation in clinical practice.\n\nThe risk of an adverse reaction event or manifestation should not be recorded without identifying a proposed causative substance or class of substance. If there is uncertainty that a specific substance is the cause, this uncertainty can be recorded using the ‘Verification status’ data element. If there are multiple possible substances that may have caused a reaction/manifestation, each substance should be recorded using a separate instance of this adverse reaction archetype with the ‘Status’ set to an initial state of ‘Unconfirmed’ so that adverse reaction checking can be activated in clinical systems. Once the substance, agent or class is later proven not to be the cause for a given reaction then the ‘Status’ can be modified to ‘Refuted’.\n\nThis item has been designed to allow recording of information about a specific substance (amoxycillin, oysters, or bee sting venom) or, alternatively, a class of substance (eg Penicillins). If a class of substance is recorded then identification of the exact substance can be recorded on a per exposure basis.",

The scope of this item includes both recording of problems or diagnoses that have an inheritable origin as well as those that are not directly inheritable but influenced by the domestic setting, including psycho-social or environmental factors. Examples include exposure to toxins in the family environment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, alcoholism and other addictions.\n\nNon-genetic family members can include adopted or long term fostered children, those related by marriage, or other unrelated individuals who participate in the regular life and influence of the family.\n\nIt may be necessary to identify each family member specifically and not just by the relationship to the individual. For example, while there will be only one maternal grandmother, there may be many female maternal cousins. This may be required to ensure that a pedigree chart is accurate. It will also enable accurate amendments to the record for each identified family member. If the record is private and will not be shared, for reasons of clarity it may be preferable to record the relative's actual name.
