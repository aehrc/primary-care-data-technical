        "comment": "Since GP software systems support substance, reaction.substance should be filled out in preference of this field.\r\n\r\nIt is strongly recommended that this element be populated using a terminology, where possible. For example, some terminologies used include RxNorm, SNOMED CT, DM+D, NDFRT, ICD-9, IDC-10, UNI, ATC and CPT. Plain text should only be used if there is no appropriate terminology available. Additional details can be specified in the text.\r\rWhen a substance or product code is specified for the 'code' element, the \"default\" semantic context is that this is a positive statement of an allergy or intolerance (depending on the value of the 'type' element, if present) condition to the specified substance/product.  In the corresponding SNOMED CT allergy model, the specified substance/product is the target (destination) of the \"Causative agent\" relationship.\r\rThe 'substanceExposureRisk' extension is available as a structured and more flexible alternative to the 'code' element for making positive or negative allergy or intolerance statements.  This extension provides the capability to make \"no known allergy\" (or \"no risk of adverse reaction\") statements regarding any coded substance/product (including cases when a pre-coordinated \"no allergy to x\" concept for that substance/product does not exist).  If the 'substanceExposureRisk' extension is present, the AllergyIntolerance.code element SHALL be omitted."
